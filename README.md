# About me
Hi, I'm Gianfranco, also known as Gian or Shuan/Sh√ºan, and I like to create mods or develop games (currently using Godot Engine 4.3).
I am by no means an expert, in fact I am a newcomer to software engineering, but I'll do my best to keep improving.

I plan to include some of my works here, *as I believe open source projects can help me understand how to work better and aid others by giving them a starting point if they're trying to to approach new things.*

Currently working on a fangame called ***Castlevania: Remnants of Darkness***.
